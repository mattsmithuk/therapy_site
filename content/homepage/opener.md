We all experience times when life becomes difficult and we struggle to manage the emotions around that .
There are times when we recognise that something isn't right and we feel out of sorts, but we can't put our finger on the problem, or we sense a general dissatisfaction with life. 
Counselling can enable you to gain insight into the challenges  and emotions  you are dealing with and help  you to develop a greater awareness of yourself and your needs.
This awareness  can help you to make changes to the way you feel, think and behave by exploring new ways to overcome the difficulties that hold you back from achieving your goals and enable you to look ahead with more clarity and a sense of direction.
