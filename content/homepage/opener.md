We all experience times when life becomes difficult and we struggle to manage the emotions around that. As a therapist I offer a safe, supportive, non-judgemental space to explore the issues you are dealing with and the thoughts and feelings you are experiencing. 

Counselling can enable you to gain insight into your issues and enable you to develop a greater awareness of yourself and your needs. It will assist you to come to terms with difficulties in coping with life past and present and in acquiring new perspectives of life situations. This will help you to make changes to the way you feel, think and behave by exploring new ways to overcome the difficulties that hold you back from achieving your goals and enable you to look ahead with more clarity and a sense of direction.
