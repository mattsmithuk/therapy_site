I am a fully qualified counsellor and psychotherapist who has 14 yearsâ€™ experience and a Registered Member of the National Counselling Society. I have gained my experience working with young people and adults who are experiencing stress, anxiety, low mood, anger, loss and bereavement amongst other complex and difficult emotions. 

I work in a person-centred way with additional training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. However, each person is unique and I am able to tailor therapy according to your individual needs.The focus is on what is important to you and to ensure we go at your pace.

As a therapist I offer a safe, supportive, non-judgemental space where together we can explore your issues, your thoughts and feelings confidentially without fear of judgment. Talking things through can bring some clarity to your thoughts and can help you explore a different, more positive future and new ways to cope with the present.
