I am a fully qualified counsellor and psychotherapist who has 12 yearsâ€™ experience in counselling young people and adults who are experiencing stress, anxiety, low mood, anger, loss and bereavement amongst other complex and difficult emotions

I work in an Integrative/Person-Centred way with additional post-graduate training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. This is a combined approach to psychotherapy that brings together different elements of specific therapies as there is no single approach that can treat each client in all situations. Each person is unique and I am able to tailor therapy according to your individual needs.

As a therapist I offer a safe, supportive, non-judgemental space to explore the issues you are dealing with, the thoughts and feelings you are experiencing. I work in an Integrative/Person-Centred way with additional post-graduate training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. However, each person is unique and I am able to tailor therapy according to your individual needs The focus is on what is important to you and to go at your pace.
My primary focus is building positive relationships with clients enabling them to make the changes they want One of the strengths in my approach is my ability to generate warmth, friendliness and to put you at ease. I offer a service that is confidential caring and compassionate

I would initially explore with you what you want to gain from the counselling process and discuss the most appropriate way forward.
