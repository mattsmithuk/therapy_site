It is important that you feel comfortable with the therapist you choose and with that in mind I offer a free initial 20-minute assessment to discuss your needs and how counselling may help. This will give you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have  and give you the opportunity to see whether you feel you would like us to continue working together.
The pace and frequency of sessions are entirely up to you. There is no obligation to book a specified number of future sessions.
I am able to offer daytime and evening appointments. 
I offer on line counselling and telephone consultations.
