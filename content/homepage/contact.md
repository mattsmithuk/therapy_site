It is important that you feel comfortable with the therapist you choose and with that in mind I offer a free initial 20-minute assessment which can be done over the phone to discuss what you are looking to resolve and for you to feel happy going forward. This will give you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about the process and for us to decide if we would be comfortable working together. Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to find out more about how I am able to help you.

##### Availability
I work flexibly in an attempt to suit all client requirements and am happy to refer and recommend alternative therapists where I cannot be of assistance Any queries just call or email.

##### Session Cost

Sessions are charged at Â£45-50 per 50-minute session, payable by cash, cheque or BACS transfer prior to the appointments. I can offer reduced rates for students and individuals on benefits or low incomes.
